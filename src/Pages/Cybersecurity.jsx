            Infrastructure Penetration Testing - Find weaknesses others overlook
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our detailed penetration test assessment uncovers vulnerabilities
          residing in IT and network systems. During our debrief presentation,
          we work with our clients to ensure they take the best possible step
          forward in strengthening their security posture. By uncovering
          weaknesses that others overlook, we outline these findings and make
          both tactical and strategic recommendations to enhance your security
          posture.

            Ransomware Penetration Testing - Evaluate your preparedness and risk
            of a ransomware attack
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Evaluates both technical (thorough penetration test) and non-technical
          (NISTIR 8374 review) controls to help you gain a deeper understanding
          of the risks and preparedness of your organization. It includes a
          thorough analysis of the security program against the Cybersecurity
          Framework Profile for Ransomware Risk Management (NISTIR 8374) to
          identify gaps in people, processes, and technology; identifying,
          protecting, detecting, responding, and recovering to ransomware
          threats.

            Objective-Based Penetration Testing - Simulate real-world, covert,
            goal-oriented attacks
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Reduce the risk of a breach with a specific objective-based approach.
          Our Objective-Based Penetration Testing goes beyond uncovering basic
          infrastructure vulnerabilities and tackles specific objective-oriented
          tasks to reduce the risk of a breach from specific people, processes,
          and technology.

        </p>
        <p>
          From source-code, all the way up to the browser - our application
          security testing reduces the risk of a breach within a web or mobile
          application. We conduct a manual testing process in addition to
          automated testing to find other vulnerabilities that may be missed in
          automation alone. Our automated testing accounts for only 5% of the
          work we do, our ethical hackers with an attacker mindset dig deeper to
          uncover vulnerabilities that VA scanners may not detect.

        <p>
          With DevSecOps, we find and flag vulnerabilities within existing
          defect management systems prior to User Acceptance Testing or
          Integration Testing, Application or End user testing. Our continuous
          vulnerability assessment and monitoring is integrated early in your
          development cycle and serves as an extension of your development team.

            Cyber Maturity Assessment - A cybersecurity health check for your
            organization
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As the first step in strengthening security posture, a Cyber Maturity
          Assessment supports the tactical direction for your cybersecurity
          strategy. This offering is for organizations that already have a solid
          security foundation and are looking to conduct a health check for any
          unknown gaps. Our assessment generates a roadmap to strengthen your
          overall security program, align with your core business objectives and
          meet contractual requirements effectively.

          <strong>Red Teaming - Assess potential attack paths </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Red teaming is a full scope, multi-layered simulated attack designed
          to get a holistic review of the level of risk and vulnerabilities
          across people, processes and technologies in an organization. The
          ethical hacker will identify and test your exposures for weaknesses
          using social engineering and stealth to avoid detection. Red teaming
          is most useful when an organization has a robust security program in
          place and is looking beyond a traditional penetration test. To get the
          most value, we recommend defining at least five goals/tasks for the
          testers to focus on.

            Cloud Penetration Testing- Go beyond the checkbox with Cloud
            Security Services
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are multiple perspectives that help with strengthening your
          security posture. These include Cloud Penetration Testing, which
          simulates an attacker in the environment, and a Cloud Penetration
          Review, which provides insights into cloud-specific vulnerabilities
          that originate from an insecure configuration. Each of these services
          can be conducted separately or, for maximum effectiveness, combined as
          an enhanced cloud security bundle.

            ICS/OT Cyber Security Assessment - Secure your industrial networks,
            devices, and production lines
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          An ICS/OT Cyber Security Assessment can help you ensure the safety and
          security of your OT devices and systems. The Tester will simulate the
          likelihood of an attacker reaching the control centre from an external
          and internal perspective with production-safe testing and can help
          identify vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts to reduce
          risk.

        <h3>Our Principles on AI adaptation and usage</h3>
        <p>
          Technology that VENIT is using based on some principles. These are
          given below:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Trust: </strong> The self-explanation capability of
          Explainable AI increases accountability. It also enhances the trust of
          customers and stakeholders.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Transparency & Explainability: </strong>
          Our system explains each prediction and output. It provides
          transparency for the logic of the model. Users get to know the
          contribution of data for the output. This disclosure justifies the
          output and builds trust. Transparency of the model lets the user adapt
          it easily by avoiding black box model questions about robustness,
          biasing, and logic.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Feasible: </strong>
          Explainable AI is feasible as it completes the coming demands without
          degrading model performance and accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Decision making: </strong>
          Tracking bias and gaps in models using interactive dashboards let the
          user fill those gaps and allow the AI system to make better decisions
          without any misleading.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Social Wellbeing: </strong>
          VENIT provides the available system for the individual, society, and
          the environment. We are doing continuous research to address all the
          challenges so that future generations can also take advantage of the
          AI system. AI shows a huge change in industries also. Healthcare,
          Gaming, Manufacturing, Banking, Embedded, IoT, Networking, Web
          Applications, etc., almost all industries are getting the benefits of
          AI.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Human-centered: </strong>
          Ethical AI system values human diversity, freedom, autonomy, and
          rights. It serves humans by respecting human values. The system is not
          performing any unfair and unjustified actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Reasonable: </strong>
          It accomplishes the reason behind each outcome of the AI system.
          Understandable: Explainable AI has the ability to understand the
          working of the model. It can check and let the user know whether the
          system is working properly or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Traceable: </strong>
          Explainable AI can track the logic and data. Users get to know the
          contribution of data in the output. The user can track problems in
          logic or data and then can solve it.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> ROI: </strong>
          Removal of the loop between plans and operating output increases ROI.
          Accordingly, changing things on time increases clarity and work
          values.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Avoid Unfair Bias: </strong>
          VENIT uses systems that are based on ethical AI. It is not doing any
          unfair discrimination against individuals or groups. It provides
          equitable access and treatment. It detects and reduces unfair biases
          based on race, gender, nationality, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Privacy and Security: </strong>
          AI systems should keep data security at the top. Our Ethical AI
          designed system provides proper data governance and model management
          system. We are designing a system that can identify vulnerabilities
          and reduce attacks.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Reliable and Safe: </strong>
          The AI system should work only for the intended purpose. Our system
          works appropriately. Safety measures are on priority for us. We always
          apply strong safety and security practices in our system. Our systems
          are fully tested and monitored.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Accountability: </strong>
          Our system provides opportunities for feedback and appeal. Our system
          is under the control of appropriate human direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Value of alignment: </strong>
          Humans are making decisions by considering universal values. The
          motive of VENIT is to provide AI that also considers those universal
          values.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> Governable: </strong>
          VENIT designing a system that works on tasks so that they give only
          intended results. It detects and avoids unintended consequences.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges of the AI System</h3>

        <p>
          Most commonly used AI systems face certain types of issues and
          challenges such as bias, opaque, data insecurity, etc. Simultaneously,
          transparency and privacy are an important concern in healthcare,
          finance, and law. If a system is opaque and cannot provide
          transparency and explainability, it threatens trust in the system. If
          there is an AI system that predicts, after two years, a person will
          have cancer. In this situation, it is sure and obvious that both the
          patient and the doctor will ask what parameters and algorithms based
          on which system predicts that a person will have cancer after two
          years are. They would also get to know whether the system performed
          correctly or not. It is not explaining to the user of the black box
          functioning of the system. As the system cannot clear the user's
          doubts, it can lose their confidence. This is just one example, but
          there are numerous issues the system can face. They are given below:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Privacy: </strong>
          Most of the data is stored digitally on a single internet. In the
          digital world, it is hard to control access to data. Therefore the
          security of data is always at risk while using AI. But in today's
          world, data security is at the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Manipulation of Behaviour: </strong>
          In AI in surveillance, the use of information or collected to
          manipulate behavior can reduce autonomous rational choice. It directly
          attacks the autonomy of individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Opacity: </strong>
          Lack of accountability, auditing, and engagement reduce opportunities
          for human perception. As well as developers, users are not aware of
          the process system use to reach the output. This opacity increases the
          bias in datasets and decision systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bias in Decision Making: </strong>
          Human beings are sometimes biased against other communities or
          systems. Unconsciously this bias enters into the AI system. This can
          be through data or the user's intention while interpreting the output
          of the system. This bias against a particular subpopulation can harm
          that specific group, which faces challenges in society.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Evil genies: </strong>
          AI can work as an evil genie that will obey the order, but the
          consequences of the way it uses to obey the order can be terrible. But
          this is only when there is a lack of understanding of full context
          when the system trains.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Security: </strong>
          When a system is designed, it is first trained then tested in several
          cases. Only after it launched in the real world, but it may be
          possible that it may not cover all the examples that systems deal with
          in the training phase. It can fool a human being by the wrong
          prediction for a new case in the real world.
        </p>

        <h3>Solutions Provided by VENIT</h3>

        <p>
          Data is sensitive and confidential in healthcare, so model data should
          be encrypted to give users confidence against system bias, understand
          and verify the system's output, and continuously monitor the model.
          Which data is used, the provenance of data and why that data is
          selected, how the model works, and which factors influence the model,
          why the particular output is obtained is also very important to ensure
          data security. Another is an AI model operationalization. ModelOps
          focus on the operationalization of all AI and decision models. It
          focuses on governance and life cycle model management of all AI and
          decision-making model knowledge based on ML (Machine Learning),
          knowledge graphs, optimization, rules, linguistics, and agents.
          Similarly, MLOps focus only on the operationalization of MLOps and
          AIOps models.
        </p>
        <p>
          To adopt AI in real life, we have to adopt explainability by design.
          It is an integral part of the system that helps to understand data
          patterns by visualization. Understanding of models can be better by
          visualizing neural net layers. By incorporating behavior morals in the
          system, it becomes easy to understand user behavior. VENIT enables
          enterprises with an AI platform and complete model management
          lifecycle model that design, develop, train, test, deploy, and monitor
          models using explainable decisions and governance. The vision of VENIT
          to reduce those issues and provide a completely transparent, secure,
          robust, trustworthy, and automated system to everyone who is looking
          for a successful and efficient AI system. VENIT is working on the
          following technologies to remove those issues and make their system
          more reliable:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Explainable AI: </strong>
          VENIT is explaining with their systems. Users can understand the data,
          model, and algorithm from this explanation. VENIT uses visualization
          to explain their system so that users can easily and quickly
          understand the system. It helps to understand and track the behavior
          of the model and the reason behind each prediction. The model's
          fairness can be improved by identifying and reducing bias in the
          model. It helps to gain user's trust and confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethical AI: </strong>
          VENIT provides AI systems that are human-centred and values human
          rights. These are aligned with the ethical principles and values of
          society. The adoption of Ethical AI allows the organization to track
          ethical issues in the system and reduce them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Privacy and Preserving AI: </strong>
          AI systems are using data points to train and make decisions. This
          data can be so expensive. It can be essential for users. For a normal
          AI system, this data should be explained to the model, which can
          breach data privacy and security. But VENIT comes with Privacy and
          Preserving AI. It lets the user secure their data and make it private.
          An encrypted data can be sent for the model. The result that will be
          generated by the model can also be obtained in an encrypted form.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>MLOps: </strong>
          VENIT enables Enterprises to efficiently streamline Machine learning
          cycles with solutions for automated deployment and administration of
          ML models. Automated Monitoring solutions empower enterprises to
          understand and Proactively identify Performance and Operational
          Issues. With an Effective MLOps platform, companies can Establish
          cross-functional governance and achieve capabilities to audit, manage
          access control in real-time.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>ModelOps: </strong>
          ModelOps similar to MLOps, but focus on all AI and decision models
          rather than limited to MLOps.

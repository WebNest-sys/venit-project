        <h3>Hogan Assessments </h3>

        <p>
          Get data-based personality insights to maximise organisational
          success.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hogan's personality assessments were developed to evaluate all facets
          of personality, the Brightside, the Darkside and the Inside.
        </p>

        <p>
          This provides employers with an objective lens through which to
          understand their people. It also enables people to perform at their
          best, manage their professional reputation and achieve their career
          goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> What can it do for me?</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Hogan Personality Inventory (The Bright Side) is an ideal tool
            to help you strengthen your employee selection, leadership
            development, succession planning, and talent management processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Hogan Development Survey describes the dark side of personality.
            Qualities that emerge in times of increased strain or when we are
            not monitoring our behaviour. This can disrupt relationships, damage
            reputations, and derail peoples chances of success. By assessing
            dark-side personality, you can recognise and mitigate performance
            risks before they become a problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Motives, Values, Preferences Inventory describes personality
            from the inside. The core goals, values, drivers, and interests that
            determine what we desire and strive to attain. By assessing values,
            you can understand what motivates people to succeed, and in what
            type of position, job, and environment they will be the most
            productive.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Talk to our team about how you can use Hogan assessments as a way of
          understanding how your people are likely to think, act, and interact
          with others in the workplace.
        </p>
        <h3>Emotional Intelligence (EIP3)</h3>

        <p>
          “Enhancing the performance of individuals and leaders. Creating
          sustainable change that drives business results.” Emotional
          Intelligence (EI) is about being able to manage your own emotions and
          understanding the emotions of those around you.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are five key elements to EI:
          <strong>
            {" "}
            self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social
            skills.{" "}
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone with high EI is aware of their emotions in a given situation
          and is able to regulate their responses. They also have a greater
          awareness of emotions behind the behaviour of others, giving them an
          understanding of the best way to interact with colleagues.
        </p>

        <p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The EIP3 questionnaire provides a detailed assessment of a person's EI
          and is used successfully in the workplace for development and
          selection.
